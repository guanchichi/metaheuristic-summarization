## [v0.6.0] - 2026-07-26 (Phase 1 research contracts)

Establishes the contracts the Phase 1 validation pilot depends on. Nothing here
is a research result: no configuration has been evaluated against a baseline yet.

### Added
- `src/data/schemas.py`, `preprocess_multinews.py`, `validate_dataset.py` —
  canonical DocumentExample with source-document boundaries, per-document
  sentence positions, deterministic NLTK Punkt segmentation, char-span mapping,
  pinned dataset revision, and a health/fingerprint report. The old flat
  Multi-News JSONL had lost `|||||` boundaries and cannot support
  cross-document objectives.
- `src/objectives/factory.py` — objectives are created only when the declared
  task profile makes them meaningful. Single-sentence tasks disable redundancy
  and subset search; profiled multi-sentence tasks reject raw-sum salience,
  which rewarded cardinality; declared-but-unimplemented document-group
  coverage raises rather than being reported as if it existed.
- `src/eval/protocol.py` — evaluation runs only under an explicitly named
  protocol. `scitldr_official` fails closed until a conformance-tested wrapper
  exists, so generic rouge-score output cannot be labelled official.
- `configs/phase1_mvp_multinews.yaml` — validation-only MVP isolating lexical +
  semantic candidate utility with a deterministic selector. Graph and NSGA-II
  are deliberately excluded from the first gate.
- GitHub Actions unit-test workflow with a light `requirements-ci.txt`.

### Changed
- Candidate generation: every enabled route now scores the complete input before
  any quota applies. `route_top_k` is proposal depth, `min_per_route` is a
  binding reservation, and RRF may fill the remaining cap only from the proposal
  union or explicit coverage guards. An infeasible cap raises; an unreachable
  cap is reported as `underfilled_by` rather than padded from the document.
- Selector salience is explicit and auditable (`base_score`, `membership_only`,
  `rrf_fusion`, `<route>_percentile`). The MVP uses `rrf_fusion`, so the
  semantic route influences ranking and not only pool membership; the other
  sources remain as ablation controls.
- The graph candidate route defaults to a bounded sparse TF-IDF kNN graph;
  dense `N x N` requires an explicit `dense_legacy` opt-in.
- Predictions no longer carry gold text; evaluation aligns by id via `--gold`.
- `length_control.unit: words` goes through the configured selector instead of a
  separate greedy path.

### Notes
- Route or feature failure fails the run. No zero-filling, no silent fallback.
- Tests: 108 pass. Still open: no baselines exist (Gate 2), so the central
  question — whether any configuration beats Lead — remains unanswered.

## [v0.5.0] - 2026-07-26 (Correctness refactor)
### Fixed
- **ROUGE protocol**: `src/eval/rouge.py` now uses `rougeLsum` for multi-sentence
  summaries (the old single-sequence `rougeL` under-scores extracts), applies the
  same segmentation to prediction and reference, and selects one reference by
  max ROUGE-1 for multi-reference data instead of concatenating references.
- **Similarity matrix corruption**: `src/features/graph.py` copied before
  thresholding; it previously mutated the caller's matrix in place, silently
  truncating the similarities NSGA-II used for coverage/redundancy.
- **Encoder reloading**: `src/models/extractive/encoder_rank.py` caches the
  tokenizer/model instead of calling `from_pretrained` once per document.
- **Unwired hyper-parameters**: `pop_size` / `n_gen` / `seed` are now read from
  config. Every previous NSGA-II run silently used the defaults (100/100)
  regardless of what the YAML declared.
- **Silent fallback removed**: `optimizer_dispatch.py` raises instead of quietly
  running greedy when NSGA-II is unavailable or the method is unknown.

### Added
- `src/eval/oracle.py` — greedy extractive oracle reference (not an exact upper bound).
- `scripts/audit/` — versioned diagnostics: local Lead comparison, selection-position
  analysis, per-dataset headroom, PLM load-vs-inference timing.
- `docs/research/` — audit findings, revision plan, target architecture, action plan.
- Guards on `scripts/quick_tune*.ps1` and `run_missing_experiments.ps1`, which tune
  on the test set.

## [v0.4.0] - 2026-01-14
### Added
- **3-Way Fusion Architecture**: Implemented a multi-view fusion pipeline combining Statistical (Base), Semantic (LLM), and Structural (Graph) scores.
- **Stage 1 Graph**: Added `src.features.graph` module implementing TextRank (PageRank) algorithm.
- **NSGA-II Integration**: Upgraded Stage 1 Base optimizer from `greedy` to `nsga2` for better candidate selection.
- ~~**Multi-News Benchmark**: Achieved **ROUGE-1: 44.32** on Multi-News, surpassing the HiMAP benchmark (44.17).~~
  > 🔴 **RETRACTED.** Three problems: (1) 44.32 does not correspond to any surviving
  > artifact — the runs in `runs/` give 43.52 (ExpB) and 43.37 (full benchmark);
  > (2) the configuration was selected using the **test set**, so the number is a
  > test-tuned artifact, not a valid result; (3) "surpassing HiMAP" compares against
  > a number from another paper computed with a different evaluator and preprocessing.
  > A local, ID-matched Lead baseline under the same evaluator scores
  > 0.4331 / 0.1453 / 0.3901 versus the system's 0.4352 / 0.1405 / 0.3880 —
  > i.e. the system does **not** beat Lead on ROUGE-2 or ROUGE-Lsum.
- ~~**Final Configs**: Standardized best-performing configurations in `configs/final/`.~~
  > That directory no longer exists; the current settings are in `configs/` (see its README).

### Changed
- **Pipeline Update**: `scripts/build_union_stage2.py` now supports 3 inputs: `--base_pred`, `--bert_pred`, and `--graph_pred`.
  > Note: that script now lives in `scripts/_archive/` and is excluded from version control.
- **Optimization**: Tuned `max_tokens` to 245 and `lambda_coverage` to 2.5 for Multi-News dataset.
  > Note: this tuning was performed on the test set (P0-01). `max_tokens` also counts
  > whitespace words, not model tokens.
